# Learning R
Experiments with R, and playing around with reading excel/csv files and parsing their data. This is a tutorial for a friend :)

# Files:
- `basic.r` : Experiments with different functions in R
- `read_xlsx.r` : Actually reads CSV, not .xlsx. Loads data and parses data, does some calculations
